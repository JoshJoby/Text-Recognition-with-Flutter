# Flutter Text Detection and Amazon Search App
The Flutter Text Detection and Amazon Search App is a mobile application developed using Flutter and Dart. It allows users to capture images, detect text from those images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and perform a search on Amazon based on the detected text. The app also includes an integrated web browser to display the search results directly within the application.

# Project Overview
The Text Detection and Amazon Search App combines the power of image processing, OCR, and web browsing to provide users with a seamless experience for searching products on Amazon. The project consists of the following components:

Image Capture: Allows users to capture images using the device's camera or select images from the gallery.

Text Detection: Utilizes OCR technology to extract text from the captured images. The app processes the image and identifies the relevant text using OCR algorithms.

Amazon Search: Performs a search on Amazon based on the detected text. The app sends the search query to the Amazon API and retrieves relevant product information.

Integrated Web Browser: Displays the search results from Amazon directly within the application using an embedded web browser. Users can browse through the search results and view product details without leaving the app.
